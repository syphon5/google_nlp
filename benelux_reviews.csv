Also their sweet potato fries. I totally recommend checking them our during the warmer months and sitting on their deck. Sometimes though, there can be quite the wait if you do want to sit up there. All and all a great place to eat.","2016-06-14","http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","Café Benelux","346 N Broadway","Milwaukee","WI",53202

It was delicious.","2016-06-14","http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","Café Benelux","346 N Broadway","Milwaukee","WI",53202

Nothing today! Great Bloody Marys, the best tater tots I've ever had (golf ball sized, with cheese and bacon on the inside), and a nice turkey with cranberry sandwich all hit the spot. Good service, too.","2016-06-14","http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","Café Benelux","346 N Broadway","Milwaukee","WI",53202

My friend and I got a spot on there roof  patio on a nice sunny day (don't forget the sunscreen). Food wise, we both got sandwiches and were only able to eat half because they were so big... and because the fries were so good we ate those first. I got the tenderloin sandwich with a modification and it came out correctly, which I appreciate. The service was nice and the view was good. We went on a Tuesday so there was no wait around lunch time, but I've been there on a Sunday and the brunch line was around the corner. So just be prepared to go early. Parking can be challenging in that area as well. Only so many spots for so many buildings. But again since the food and service was good (and usually is) I recommend it.","2016-06-14","http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","Café Benelux","346 N Broadway","Milwaukee","WI",53202

Our trip there for lunch on Thursday prior to Memorial day was no different.My friend Peter got the bitterballen (meatballs stuffed with a bit of cheesecurds and excellently spiced, served with curry ketchup) and the tater tots (stuffed with some bits of bacon, blue cheese, served with srirachi mayo) for us to share.  This was fantastic and quickly filling.  I adored the bitterballen and would definitely get them again. They were the perfect amount of fried - meat - cheese ratio. Perfectly flavored on their own. Dipping these into their sauce changed them completely. Not for the worse, but it was like having two apps in one.  Awesome!   The tater tots were great too, just a bit too creamy/rich for me.At this point I had already been saddened we'd missed breakfast, thus I couldn't order the chicken and waffles.  I instead ordered the chicken sliders which, honestly, deserve a point to be taken off because they were not good chunks of chicken. It was a lot of empty space between the chicken and the breading, and the chicken was thin.  I also ordered the cobb salad, and they did NOT skimp on any of the ingredients (including the chicken, bacon, avocado, etc).  I could only eat a little of this because I was quickly stuffed from those damn (good) bitterballen!My husband got a cheeseburger which he proclaimed was very good (and which I took a bite of and agreed, it was at least good, if not very).  He struggled to finish it, but did so because he's silly!  My friend also ordered the mac and cheese with chicken, and was a champ, finishing half the full portion.We waddled out of there, happy with our food, and desperately needing coffee.Thanks again for your consistency, Benelux.","2016-06-14","http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","caf%C3%A9-benelux-milwaukee-2","Café Benelux","346 N Broadway","Milwaukee","WI",53202
